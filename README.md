## About
In this demo application, I create a simple blog with Spring and Kotlin. Then I deploy it to Kubernetes.

#### What's the easiest way to run this application locally?
Basically, you are just going to run the shell file:

```bash
chmod +x kubeDeploy.sh
./kubeDeploy.sh
```

#### What will you need?
1. Have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) installed on your machine.
2. Manage Docker as a non-root user (optional). [Post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)
3. Have [Minikube](link) installed on your machine.
4. Have [Kubectl](link) installed on your machine.

*That's it* ðŸ¥³
